        <h2>Our Team & Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We are a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists from the Department of Data Science and Business Systems at the School of Computing, SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Our team is spearheaded by Dr. N. Vasudevan, whose extensive expertise in climate analysis guides our research, along with the innovative contributions of Akshita Sharma and Khushi Agrawal. Drawing on over a century of historical climate data from the Indian Meteorological Department, our work investigates long-term temperature and precipitation trends to uncover the dynamics of climate change in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to empower policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders by providing evidence-based insights into the evolving climate patterns that impact agricultural productivity and water resources. By integrating sophisticated statistical methods and machine learning models with comprehensive data visualization, we identify vulnerability hotspots and forecast future climate scenarios. Through this research, we aim to drive informed decision-making and support the development of adaptive strategies that safeguard communities against extreme weather events. Our commitment is to foster sustainable agricultural practices and resilient ecosystems amid the challenges posed by climate change.
